- **A-E** - Five status LEDs managed by the debug microcontroller.

    - **A** - Power Indicator.
    - **B** - FPGA is online.
    - **C** - FPGA has requested control of the  **CONTROL** port.
    - **D** - FPGA has control of the **CONTROL** port.
    - **E** - Reserved for future use.

- **0-5** - Six USER LEDs managed by the FPGA.

- **PROGRAM** - Press this button to return control of the **CONTROL** port to the debug microcontroller and hold the FPGA in an unconfigured state.

    - *Recovery mode*: Press this button during power-on to invoke the `Saturn-V <https://github.com/greatscottgadgets/saturn-v>`__ bootloader on the **CONTROL** port.

- **CONTROL**  - Primary USB connector used by the host computer to control Cynthion.
- **USER**     - A user-assignable button that can be used in your own designs.
- **AUX**      - An auxiliary USB connection that can be used in your own designs.
