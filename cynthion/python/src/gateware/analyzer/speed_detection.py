class USBAnalyzerSpeedDetector(Elaboratable):
    """ Gateware that detects reset signaling on the USB bus.

    Attributes
    ----------
    vbus_connected: Signal(), input
        Indicates that the device is connected to VBUS. When this is de-asserted, the device will
        be held in perpetual bus reset, and reset handshaking will be disabled.
    line_state: Signal(2), input
        The UTMI linestate signals; used to read the current state of the USB D+ and D- lines.

    bus_reset: Signal(), output
        Strobe; pulses high for one cycle when a bus reset is detected. This signal indicates that the
         device should return to unaddressed, unconfigured, and should not longer be in High Speed mode.
    suspended: Signal(), output
        Held high while the USB device should be in suspend. This technically indicates that the device should
        drop down to consuming suspend current (<= 2.5mA), but very few devices are compliant with this requirement.
        Either way, a polite device might reduce its power consumption while in suspend.

    current_speed: Signal(2), output
        A USBSpeed value that indicates the current operating speed. Used both to drive our device's
        knowledge of operating speed and to drive our PHY's speed selection.
